# Project Happy Thoughts API
In this weeks project we were suppposed to create our own API to connect to our Frontend project Happy Thoughts we made during week 11.


## The problem
I think this project went quite well, I managed to get the endpoints to work. The problem was, as last week, to deploy it. I had some problems with the mongo compass and mongo cloud but got it to work after trying different solutions.

Endpoints:
GET '/thoughts' to show all thoughts
POST '/thoughts' to post thoughts
POST '/thoughts/:id/like' to like thoughts
