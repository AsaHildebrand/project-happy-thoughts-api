# Project Happy Thoughts API
In this weeks project we were suppposed to create our own API for our Front end project Happy Thoughts we made during week


## The problem



thoughts/ GET to send and retrieve thougths
thoughts/:id/like POST to like thoughts

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
